TakeBackTheHouse
================

Event based web app to take back the house of representatives in 2014.

The web app will allow users to see the interactive map interface without having to log in or register.

The map will focus on Republican held districts that are "swing" districts in the sense that they are tossups or slightly learn Republican.  The map will then have filter layers based on time and events that have occured in the disticts that are salient issues that President Obama has been unable to address via legislation due to the House of Representatives being Republican majority controlled. The future of any meaningful legislation that can benefit the American public is completely riding on the ability of Democrats to pick up 17 Republican controlled seats and hold off any Republicans from picking off Democratic seats.  If and only if the House and Senate are majority controlled by the Democrats can Obama actually implement any strong federal legistlation that can help the American people. 

Events as defined for purposes of this map include external events that are independent of politics as well as right wing ideological comments and attempts at radical bills that are completely out of touch with the majority of public opinion polls.

* extreme weather events that can be reasonably attributed to climate change and have caused agricultural desctruction, water issues, recreational problems for industries such as ski resorts, property destruction, and deaths.
The events will focus on:
* school shootings or mass shootings by individuals who had access to military grade assault guns with high capacity magazines and in which the individuals where able to legally purchase such weapons with lax or no background check.
* districts with high rates of home foreclosures that have still not had proper relief despite attempts at government intervention
